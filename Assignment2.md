# Design Proposal

In our current era, our energy consumption continues to grow, however, we also wish to transition away from non-renewable energy such as fossil fuels.
As such, finding new ways to effciciently and cheaply produce electriticy is always in demand.
One of these sources of energy has been the usage of dams to store water and produce electricity as needed. These dams create resovoirs upstream to where they are built
resulting in large areas in which no other infrastrucuture can be built. However, dams and resovoirs can still be further utilized through usage of solar panels.

In recent years, developments in solar panels have resulted in both greater efficiency and reduced costs. In order to further increase the energy output of dams, solar panels can
be instealled along the dam as well as on top of the resovoir the dam creates. On top of this, there solar farms can utilize the pre-existing electrical infrstucture
of the dams with minimal need for construction of new transmission sites.

It can be expected that the extra production of energy would decrease the chances of there being a shortage in the areas the dam serves and can also be utilized to serve
other areas in need of more energy. 

The cost and viability of such a project would depend on the location chosen and each location would require an individual anlysis if implementation would be beneficial.
Multiple factors must be acounted for such as weather and maintaince.
Likewise, the cost for implementing sucha  project would also be location dependent.
